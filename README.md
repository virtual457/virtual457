# Hi, I'm Chandan 👋

**MS Computer Science @ Northeastern University (3.89 GPA) | Seeking Summer 2026 Co-op**

I'm a graduate student passionate about distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and building scalable software. With production engineering experience from LSEG and hands-on projects in Kubernetes, deep learning, and backend systems, I bring a strong foundation in software engineering while actively learning cutting-edge technologies through my graduate studies.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

- **Summer 2026 Software Engineering Co-op** (May - December 2026)
- Opportunities to apply production experience while learning from experienced engineers
- Focus areas: Backend systems, cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, ML engineering

## 🔧 Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python • Java • Go • C++ • JavaScript/TypeScript

**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS (Lambda, SQS, API Gateway) • Kubernetes • Docker • Terraform • Serverless Architecture

**Backend:** Microservices • Event-Driven Systems • REST APIs • Distributed Systems • Performance Optimization

**Data:** MySQL • PostgreSQL • MongoDB • ETL Pipelines • Batch Processing

**AI/ML:** PyTorch • TensorFlow • Deep Reinforcement Learning • Computer Vision

## 💼 Experience Highlights

Previously worked as a Software Engineer at **London Stock Exchange Group** where I:
- Built event-driven systems processing **7.5M+ compliance records** across **180+ countries**
- Architected AWS serverless pipelines with **40% latency reduction** and **99.9% uptime**
- Optimized distributed data processing achieving **40 records/second** throughput
- Worked with Python, Java, AWS Lambda/SQS, and microservices architecture

Currently pursuing **MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University** to deepen expertise in distributed systems and cloud-native architectures before completing my final year of coursework.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
